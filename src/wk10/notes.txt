Inheritance
Def: creating a class BASED on another class
    every class created is BASED on Object class
        Object: fundamental data type of everything in Java
                toString(), equals(), getClass(), hashCode(), default constructor

Why create a class based on another class:
    To have a starting point

What is inherited / what do you have access to?
    instance variables
    methods
    constants
    default constructor
        * non-private (default, protected, public)

OLD                                             NEW

parent                                          child
base                                            derived
super                                           sub



It is impossible to remove existence of instance variables and methods
